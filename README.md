# Minesweeper Solver
This repository contains program(s) to solve minesweeper grids of any size.

- **Solver_v1:** Full fledged solver with 5 layered logic with Monte Carlo Simulation based guessing fallback mechanism, takes manual input for grid.
- **Solver_V2:** Improved solver with safer guessing and more robust brute force mechanism
